## Computational Biology

This site contains the teaching material for the course [**Computational Biology**](https://formations.univ-amu.fr/ME5SIN-S51IN1Z4-en.html) taught in the 1st year of the Master [*Computational and Mathematical Biology*](https://formations.univ-amu.fr/ME5SBI-PRSBI5AA-en.html) at [Aix-Marseille Université](https://www.univ-amu.fr/).

### Teachers

1. Laurent Pezard
2. Michael Kopp
3. Jacques van Helden

### Target audience

- This course is conceived to be followed by a mixed audience of students having a background in either biology or mathematics. 
- Biological and mathematical concepts will thus be introduced progressively. 
- For the practicals, students will be encouraged to form interdisciplinary teams (1 biologist + 1 mathematician) in order to combine their respective skills. 

### Tentative program (Jacques van Helden)

The first session (sequence similarity search) partly overlaps with the introductory courses of bioinformatics taught in Life Science Bachelor programs. However, the practical will go a bit further than what has been taught in bachelor. 

1. The practical will rely on a command-line use of the BLAST algorithm, with options specifically tuned to collect a family of proteins from the full proteome of an organism of interest.
2. The practical will also introduce the way to run the analyses on a computer cluster (IFB core cluster), by sending them to a job scheduler (slurm).
